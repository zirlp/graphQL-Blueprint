# Bizinta onboarding proyect.

<p>This is a project designed primarily to learn and practice GraphQL as a data provider (API) and Blueprint for styles. All within the React framework.
The main objective is to create an application in which you can consult information from countries around the world through filters and a searchbar. Likewise, you can also edit said information and add contact information of people from each country and all, of course, with a good Blueprint appearance. </p>

<h3> Instructions to run the app. </h3>

<ul>
<li> Make sure you have npm and git bash installed on you system.</li>
<li> Copy the repo link to make a clone on your system and then open the main folder(onboarding).</li>
<li> Install all the needed packages through the terminal with the command: npm i </li>
<li> Wait for the packages to install and then run the app with the command: npm start </li>
<li> Once the app starts on your browser, you're going to be able to search for any country in the API. </li>
</ul>
